# Chess Oven

Complete chess game that runs locally built in vanilla JS

All features: fully functional pieces, promotion, castling, en passant, timer, surrender and other skibidi shits. You might find some bugs and errors. If you want us to fix it, please donate us some monion.

We built this as a way to practice javascript and making functional, adaptive UIs. **KOBE BRYANT IS THE GOAT. RIP**
